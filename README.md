# CartPole
This project will demonstrate how deep reinforcement learning can be implemented and applied to play a CartPole game using Keras and Gym.

# Reinforcement learning
Q-function: used to approximate the reward based on a state
Q(s,a) :Calculates the expected future value from state "s" and action "a"
Deep Q network (DQN) : approximate reward based on the state

The state in CartPole is composed by 4 observations :
Cart position
Cart velocity
Pole angle
Pole velocity at tip
